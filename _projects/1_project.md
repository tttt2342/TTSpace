Investigated the effects of rare earth doping (e.g., Yb, La) on cerium, employing high-temperature and high-pressure synthesis to modulate phase transition pressures and explore the stabilization of high-pressure phases at ambient conditions.

Conducted synthesis experiments with various high-pressure assemblies under different power and pressure conditions; prepared bulk samples by removing impurities and polishing them inside a glovebox to minimize oxidation.  

Performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis to evaluate doping efficiency, sample purity, and oxidation state by comparing results with reference spectra for alpha-Ce and gamma-Ce phases; used GSAS software to refine lattice constants and validate structural changes.

Characterized phase transition behaviors and the electrical/magnetic properties of doped samples using diamond anvil cell (DAC) techniques under variable pressure conditions.
