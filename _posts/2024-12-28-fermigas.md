##### Fermi Energy
In the low-temperature limit $$T \to 0$$, the Fermi distribution is going to become a step function.
This means that all states with energy below the **Fermi energy**
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_F = \mu(n,0)
\end{equation}
are occupied, and all those above are empty.
We know the state density in the momentum space:
\begin{equation}
g(p) = \frac{V}{(2\pi\hbar)^3} \cdot 4\pi p^2
\end{equation}
and consider the spin degeneracy, we can obtain the following number of particles by integral.
\begin{equation}
N = nV = \frac{V(2S+1)}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{4\pi}{3}k_F^3
\end{equation}
where $$k_F = p_F / \hbar$$ is the Fermi wave number. Thus the Fermi surface is described by
\begin{equation}
k_F = (\frac{6\pi^2n}{2S+1})^{1/3}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_F = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(\frac{6\pi^2n}{2S+1})^{2/3}
\end{equation}
