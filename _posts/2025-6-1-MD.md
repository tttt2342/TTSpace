## Basic Idea
Molecular dynamics (MD) is a computer simulation technique that allows one to predict the time evolution of a system of interacting particles (atoms, molecules, granules, etc.).
First we have to specify:
- aset of **initial conditions** (positions & velocities)
- **interaction potential** for deriving the forces among all the particles.

Second, the evolution in time can be followed by solving a  set of classical equations of motion for all particles in the system. Within the framework of classical mechanics, the equations are:
\begin{equation}
m_i\frac{d^2 \vec r_i}{dt^2}=\vec F_i
\end{equation}
for the $$i^{\text{th}}$$ particle.

If the particles of interest are atoms, the force acting on the $$i^{\text{th}}$$ atom at a given time can be obtained from the interatomic potential $$U$$ :
\begin{equation}
\vec F_i = -\vec \Nabla_i U(\vec r_1,\vec r_2,\vec r_3,...,\vec r_{N_at})
\end{equation}

#### Advantages of MD
- The only input in the model - description of interatomic interaction
- No assumptions are made about the process
- Provides a detailed molecular/atomic-level information
- The main strengths of MD is the ability to study **fast non-equilibrium processes** with atomic-level resolution.

#### Limitations of Classic MD
- Usage of classical forces - ignoring quantum mechanical laws - de Brogile wavelength $$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$
- Quantum effects become important when $$T$$ is quite low - Thermal de Brogile wavelength $$\lambda_{th} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2\pi mk_B T}}$$
- Time-scale limitations
- length-scale limitations
