## Basic Concepts
ODE depends only on one variable and has the structure:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y) \text{or} \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = f(x,y,\frac{dy}{dx})
\end{equation}
A second order ODE can be transformed into a coupled set of first order of ODEs:
\begin{equation}
p = \frac{dy}{dx};\frac{dp}{dx}=f(x,y,p)
\end{equation}

## Numerical Methods
### 1. Euler Algorithm
Approximate derivative by forward difference:
\begin{equation}
y_{n+1}=y_n+hf(x_n,y_n)+O(h^2)
\end{equation}
Euler method has mainly educational value. It is not very accurate, and encounters stability problems.

### 2. Verlet Algorithm
Designed for Newton's Second Law $$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=a(x,t)$$. Use the central difference to eliminate the odd terms, keeping the time reversal symmetry.
\begin{equation}
x_{n+1}=2x_n-x_{n-1}+h^2a_n
\end{equation}
