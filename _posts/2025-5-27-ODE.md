## Basic Concepts
ODE depends only on one variable and has the structure:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y) \text{ or } \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = f(x,y,\frac{dy}{dx})
\end{equation}
A second order ODE can be transformed into a coupled set of first order of ODEs:
\begin{equation}
p = \frac{dy}{dx};\frac{dp}{dx}=f(x,y,p)
\end{equation}

## Numerical Methods
### 1. Euler Algorithm
Approximate derivative by forward difference:
\begin{equation}
y_{n+1}=y_n+hf(x_n,y_n)+O(h^2)
\end{equation}
Euler method has mainly educational value. It is not very accurate, and encounters stability problems.

### 2. Verlet Algorithm
Designed for Newton's Second Law $$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=a(x,t)$$. Use the central difference to eliminate the odd terms, keeping the time reversal symmetry.
\begin{equation}
x_{n+1}=2x_n-x_{n-1}+h^2a_n
\end{equation}

### 3. Leapfrog Algorithm
Leapfrog Algorithm implies the evaluation of position and velocity at different time steps. The algorithm is given by the following steps:

1. First calculate the velocity half step later by current acceleration.
\begin{equation}
x^{(1)}(t+h/2)=x^{(1)}(t-h/2)+hx^{(2)}(t)+O(h^2)
\end{equation}
2. Calculate the position at next step.
\begin{equation}
x(t+h)=x(t)+hx^{(1)}(t+h/2)+O(h^3)
\end{equation}
3. Calculate current acceleration.
\begin{equation}
x^{(1)}(t+h)=(x^{(1)}(t+h/2)+\frac{h}{2}x^{(2)}(t+h))+O(h^2)
\end{equation}

### 4. Predictor-Corrector Mtehods
In addition to Euler's method, we can compute the slope $$k_2$$ at $$t_{i+1}$$ with the result of Euler's method $$y_{i+1}$$ (prediction). Then take the average of two slopes and compute again with: 
\begin{equation}
y_{i+1} \approx y(t_i)+\frac{h}{2} (k_1+k_2)
\end{equation}

### 5. Runge-Kutta Methods
Runge-Kutta methods use a trial step at the **midpoint** of an interval to cancel out lower-order error terms.
#### Second-Order Formula
\begin{equation}
k_1 = hf(t_i,y_i); k_2 = hf(t_{i+1/2},y_i+k_1/2)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
y_{i+1} \approx y_i+k_2+O(h^3)
\end{equation}

#### Fourth-Order Formula
1. We compute first $$k_1=hf(t_i,y_i)$$, which is nothing but the slope at $$t_i$$ (Euler's method).
2. Then we compute the slope at the midpoint $$t_{i}+h/2$$ using Euler's prediction, as in the second-order RK:
\begin{equation}
k_2 = hf(t_i+h/2,y_i+k_i/2).
\end{equation}
3. The improved slope at the midpoint is used to further improve the slope of $$y_{i+1/2}$$ by computing
\begin{equation}
k_3 = hf(t_i+h/2,y_i+k_2/2).
\end{equation}
4. With $$k_3$$ we can predice $$y_{i+1}=y_i+k_3$$ and compute the slope at $$t_i+h$$:
\begin{equation}
k_4 = hf(t_i+h,y_i+k_3).
\end{equation}
5. The final algorithm becomes then
\begin{equation}
y_{i+1}=y_i+\frac{1}{6}(k_1+2k_2+2k_3+k_4).
\end{equation}

### Summery


In the case of energy-conserving systems (no damping or external driving forces):
- Use the **Verlet/leapfrog algorithm**
- 
In the case of non-energy-conserving systems (including damping or external driving forces)
- Use the **RK algorithm**

## Second-Order ODE Problems
### Boundary-Value Problems (BVP)
In this case of problems, we can not use step algorithms directly because only know $$u(0)$$ or $$u'(0)$$.
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}=f(x,u,u'), x\in [x_{lb},x_{rb}]
\end{equation}
#### Boundary Conditions
- Dirichlet: $$u(x_{lb}),u(x_{rb})$$ provided.
- Neumann: $$u'(x_{lb}),u'(x_{rb})$$ provided.
- Periodic: $$u(x_{lb})=u(x_{rb})$$ and $$u'(x_{lb})=u'(x_{rb})$$.
- Mixed: combination of Dirichlet and Neumann.

### Eigenvalue Problems
Solution that satisfies BC only exists for specific $$\lambda$$(eigenvalue).
For example (1-D TISE):
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}=-\frac{2m}{\hbar^2}[E-V(x)]\psi(x)
\end{equation}

## Methods
### Shooting Method
Shooting method transfers BVP into IVP+root search problem:
1. Assume unknown initial parameter. (e.g. $$u'(0)=\alpha$$)
2. Compute trial solution $$u_\alpha(1)$$ with step forward algorithm (RK4).
3. Define target function: $$F(\alpha)=u_\alpha(1)-u(1)$$.
4. Search root $$\alpha$$ s.t. $$F(\alpha)=0$$.

### Superposition Shooting Method
If linear equation $$u''+d(x)u'+q(x)u=s(x)$$:
We need only two trial solutions $$u_{\alpha_0}$$ and $$u_{\alpha_1}$$. The correct solution of the equation is
\begin{equation}
u(x)=au_{\alpha_0}(x)+bu_{\alpha_1}(x),
\end{equation}
where $$a$$ and $$b$$ are determined from $$u(0)=u_0$$ and $$u(1)=u_1$$:
\begin{equation}
a=\frac{u_{\alpha_1}(1)-u_1}{u_{\alpha_1}(1)-u_{\alpha_0}(1)};b=\frac{u_1-u_{\alpha_0}(1)}{u_{\alpha_1}(1)-u_{\alpha_0}(1)}
\end{equation}

### Numerov's Algorithm
Consider the equation
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}+q(x)u(x)=s(x),
\end{equation}
which does not have a first-order derivative term.

From three-point difference we have the formula
\begin{equation}
(1+\frac{h^2}{12}q_{n+1})u_{n+1}-2(1+\frac{5h^2}{12}q_n)u_n+(1+\frac{h^2}{12}q_{n-1})u_{n-1}=\frac{h^2}{12}(s_{n+1}+10s_n+s_{n-1})+O(h^6).
\end{equation}
