## Basic Concepts
ODE depends only on one variable and has the structure:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x,y) \text{ or } \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} = f(x,y,\frac{dy}{dx})
\end{equation}
A second order ODE can be transformed into a coupled set of first order of ODEs:
\begin{equation}
p = \frac{dy}{dx};\frac{dp}{dx}=f(x,y,p)
\end{equation}

## Numerical Methods
### 1. Euler Algorithm
Approximate derivative by forward difference:
\begin{equation}
y_{n+1}=y_n+hf(x_n,y_n)+O(h^2)
\end{equation}
Euler method has mainly educational value. It is not very accurate, and encounters stability problems.

### 2. Verlet Algorithm
Designed for Newton's Second Law $$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=a(x,t)$$. Use the central difference to eliminate the odd terms, keeping the time reversal symmetry.
\begin{equation}
x_{n+1}=2x_n-x_{n-1}+h^2a_n
\end{equation}

### 3. Leapfrog Algorithm
Leapfrog Algorithm implies the evaluation of position and velocity at different time steps. The algorithm is given by the following steps:

1. First calculate the velocity half step later by current acceleration.
\begin{equation}
x^{(1)}(t+h/2)=x^{(1)}(t-h/2)+hx^{(2)}(t)+O(h^2)
\end{equation}
2. Calculate the position at next step.
\begin{equation}
x(t+h)=x(t)+hx^{(1)}(t+h/2)+O(h^3)
\end{equation}
3. Calculate current acceleration.
\begin{equation}
x^{(1)}(t+h)=(x^{(1)}(t+h/2)+\frac{h}{2}x^{(2)}(t+h))+O(h^2)
\end{equation}

### 4. Predictor-Corrector Mtehods
In addition to Euler's method, we can compute the slope $$k_2$$ at $$t_{i+1}$$ with the result of Euler's method $$y_{i+1}$$ (prediction). Then take the average of two slopes and compute again with: 
\begin{equation}
y_{i+1} \approx y(t_i)+\frac{h}{2} (k_1+k_2)
\end{equation}
