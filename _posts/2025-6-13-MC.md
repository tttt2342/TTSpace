## Introduction to Monte Carlo
Methods which make use of **random numbers** are often called *Monte Carlo Methods* named after the Casino Monte Carlo in Monaco which has long been famous for games of chance. MC methods vary, bute tend to follow a particular pattern:
- Define a domain of possible inputs
- Generate inputs randomly from a probability distribution
- Perform a deterministic computation on the inputs.
- Aggregate the results.

## Math Foundation of MC Methods
### 1. Law of Large Numbers (LLN)
Assume $$\xi_1, \xi_2, ..., \xi_n$$ is a random i.i.d. variable series, with math expectation $$E(xi_i) = \mu$$. Then for arbitrary $$\epsilon > 0$$, there is:
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n \to \infty} p \lbrace |\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \xi_i-\mu| < \epsilon \rbrace = 1.
\end{equation}
This means when $$n$$ goes large, the average of samples convert to math expectation.

### 2. Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
In addition to above, if the square difference $$D(\xi_i) = \sigma^2$$, then for arbitrary real number $$\lambda$$:
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n \to \infty} p \lbrace \frac{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \xi_i-\mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} < \lambda \rbrace = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^\lambda e^{-(x^2 /2)} dx,
\end{equation}
which means when $$n$$ goes large, the mean value of i.i.d. random variables approximately follows a normal distribution with average $$\mu$$ and square difference $$\sigma^2 /n$$.
