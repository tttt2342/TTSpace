##### Photons
With the energy-momentum relation $$\epsilon = cp$$, we can write the average occupation number with momentum:
\begin{equation}
n_p = \frac{1}{e^{\beta c p}-1}
\end{equation}
in which we can see the chemical potential of photons is 0. The average number of photon is calculated by integrating
\begin{equation}
N = 2\sum_{\vec p}n_p = 2V\int \frac{d^3p}{h^3}\frac{1}{e^{\beta cp}-1}
\end{equation}
The favtor 2 comes from the states of polarization. Turning it into a integral w.r.t. $$k$$ and integrate by sphere, we can obtain the density of photons:
\begin{equation}
n=\frac{2}{(2\pi)^3}\int_{0}^{\infty} dk\frac{4\pi k^2}{e^{\beta\hbar ck}-1}=\kappa (\frac{k_B T}{\hbar c})^3
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
\kappa = \frac{1}{\pi^2}\int_{0}^{\infty} dx\frac{x^2}{e^x -1}=4\zeta(3) \approx 0.23
\end{equation}
##### Internal Energy of Photons
The internal energy is 
\begin{equation}
U=2\sum_{\vec p} \epsilon_p n_p=\frac{V\hbar}{\pi^2c^3}\int_{0}^{\infty}d\omega \frac{\omega^3}{e^{\beta \hbar \omega}-1}
\end{equation}
leading to **Stefan's law**:
\begin{equation}
\frac{U}{V}=\sigma T^4
\end{equation}
where $$\sigma = \pi^2 k^4/15(\hbar c)^3$$ is the Stefan's constant.
##### Planck Distribution
The energy density per unit frequancy interval is
\begin{equation}
u(\omega,T)=\frac{\hbar}{\pi^2 c^3}\frac{\omega^3}{e^{\beta \hbar \omega}-1}
\end{equation}
which is called the Planck distribution. With this we can express the energy density
\begin{equation}
\frac{U}{V} = \int_{0}^{\infty}d\omega u(\omega,T)
\end{equation}
##### Pressure
The relation between pressure and energy density is
\begin{equation}
P=\frac{1}{3}\frac{U}{V}
\end{equation}
which also holds for massive particles at temperatures so high that they move at close to light speed.
